## Goals

As part of its national MYGovServ 2.0 initiative, **Telekom Malaysia commissioned us to develop a centralized enterprise-grade Data Lake platform**. The goal was to enable slicing, management, and near real-time ingestion of vast volumes of **structured and unstructured data** originating from **15,000 government sites** across Malaysia and globally.

This platform would serve as a **foundation for big data analytics**, helping TM to unlock insights, improve decision-making, and pave the way for future adoption of **machine learning and AI-driven operations** — while integrating seamlessly into the existing MYGovServ 2.0 infrastructure.

## Insights

Data across the MYGovServ environment was scattered across various systems — including **BSS, OSS, billing, monitoring, ticketing, and assurance tools** — with no centralized platform to consolidate, store, and analyze it. TM required a solution capable of handling **high-velocity data streams, complex ETL operations, and real-time analytics**, all deployed on a **Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI)**.

At the time, there was no existing platform to serve this function — making the development of a **purpose-built Data Lake** both urgent and critical to the platform&apos;s evolution.

## Approach &amp; Solutions

We architected and delivered a **high-throughput Data Lake platform**, capable of ingesting, storing, transforming, and analyzing data from thousands of sources — amounting to over **5 million records per minute, 3 TB of raw data monthly consisting about 135 Billion records**.

Built on a **containerized Kubernetes architecture**, the solution supports:

- **Near real-time data ingestion pipelines**
- **ETL workflows** tailored to MYGovServ&apos;s heterogeneous data landscape
- **Custom dashboard reporting** for traffic and security insights
- **Workflow orchestration tools** to manage dependencies and automate scheduled jobs
- **Monitoring and observability tools** to track system health, ingestion rates, storage usage, and resource allocation
- **Full administrative control** for TM to monitor, configure, and scale compute, storage, and security settings

The system was designed not only to meet today&apos;s operational needs but to **future-proof TM&apos;s infrastructure** — setting the stage for advanced analytics and AI/ML model deployment across the public sector.

## Results

TM now operates a **fully integrated, enterprise-scale Data Lake** platform that empowers MYGovServ with real-time visibility into network, infrastructure, and application operations across **15,000+ government sites**. The solution enables data-driven strategy from siloed and reactive to **centralized and predictive**.

By consolidating high-volume data into a unified platform, TM has laid the groundwork for **data-driven governance, national-level operational intelligence, and AI adoption** — positioning Telekom Malaysia and MYGovServ as the backbone of Malaysia&apos;s digital transformation.
