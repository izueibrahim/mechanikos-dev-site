## Goals

We were tasked to bring **national wellness campaign to a new level and redefine fun, healthy living.**

## Insights

**1 in 2 Malaysians are overweight with 1 in 4 being physically inactive.**

The primary issue is that Malaysians find it tedious and uninteresting to maintain a healthy lifestyle, leading to a lack of motivation.

## Approach and Solutions

Utilizing social and digital platforms to enhance social interaction and boost participation in on-ground events, we created a **campaign video with a target audience of 1 million views**, **influencer campaign with a target of 40 influencers**, and **social media &amp; digital online contests**. We organized **319 activities throughout Malaysia**, each specifically designed to cater to different demographic groups for maximum relevance. The main video emphasizes the crucial aspects of BMSS, and gets people moving!
