## Goals

Telekom Malaysia engaged us to develop a billing system for the MYGovServ platform, a national digital infrastructure serving over 15,000 government sites across ministries and agencies in Malaysia. The goal was to create a custom full-suite billing engine capable of managing complex network usage for both Pay-You-Use and No-Pay-You-Use models, while supporting diverse package tiers, rate structures, and financial policies.

Additionally, TM required a deployment solution to provide billing visibility at every level — from the Federal Government to Jabatan Digital Negara (JDN) down to individual ministries and agencies — complete with usage projections and budget monitoring. The platform needed to integrate tightly with the existing MYGovServ infrastructure, network topology, and internal application ecosystem.

## Insights

No commercially available off-the-shelf billing system could support the scale, complexity, and policy-driven billing logic required by a national platform like MYGovServ. The billing process involved multiple charging models including Fixed, PAYU, LAD (Liquidated Ascertained Damages), TBU (temporary bandwidth under-utilization), and varying billing periods based on device type, subscription package, and agency classification.

Prior to this, billing operations were manually activated via Excel spreadsheets and macros — a method that was labor-intensive, prone to human error, and unable to scale to thousands of billing entries monthly with audit-level precision.

## Approach & Solutions

Working closely with TM, we engineered a high-availability billing architecture designed for 24/7 reliability, accuracy, and resilience. To handle the massive volume of network data coming from thousands of endpoints from ManageEngine OpManager, we introduced a middleware-driven pipeline featuring an aggregation channel (Ingest and ETL), followed by a custom-built calculation engine that interprets package logic, applies billing conditions, and processes PAYU computations automatically.

A custom analytics dashboard was developed to deliver real-time financial insights, enabling ministries and agencies to monitor usage trends, allocation forecasting, and budget status through a clear multi-user interface.

Every component was built following telecom industry enterprise standards, aligned with national infrastructure compliance, cybersecurity protocols, and TM's strict internal governance.

## Results

The MYGovServ billing system is now fully automated and live at national scale, powering accurate monthly billing for over 15,000 government clients with zero-touch execution and zero manual intervention. Government billing reconciliation teams can now process billing faster, maintain audit readiness, and generate high-level billing intelligence on demand through dashboard analytics.

This transformation marked a significant shift — from fragmented, macro-based billing workflows to a centralized national-grade billing ecosystem built to support Malaysia's digital government agenda, with TM as the backbone infrastructure provider.
